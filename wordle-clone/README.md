Wordle clone that I have learned to make via this course:
https://realpython.com/python-wordle-clone/

I highly recommend the video course. It is very well structured. It contains a lot of interesting and useful nuggets of information. Especially the test driven development (TDD) was great to see in action.

I have made my additions to Real Python's course i.e., I have added an English dictionary check.
The source for the dictionary can be found here:

Dependency: https://pypi.org/project/rich/ 

Enjoy! 😎
