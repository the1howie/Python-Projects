Football (Soccer) League Generator

There are two versions of this notebook i.e., the OOP version and the more procedural (spaghetti code) version.

Each notebook allows the user to input the football teams list for their league.
Then it generates the match schedules. One can input the scores manually, or randomly generate results.
The league table is generated thereafter. And on can search for their favourite team.

This project was inspired by Paul Kelly's video for his football league generator in Excel / VBA.
